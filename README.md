Hotel Reservations
Background
Imagine you own a hotel with a certain number of identical rooms - let's call this number the size of your hotel.
Your clients would like to make reservations for rooms: They e.g. call to check if they can make a reservation for
one room from a certain start date start until a certain end date end. For each booking request you will have
to check if there is a room available and either confirm the booking or reject it.
Goal
Your task is to write a small interactive application to check the availability of rooms. In addition: Please
implement the test cases described below to automically test your solution.
You may use either Java, JavaScript, or TypeScript as a programming language.
Feel free to also include necessary libraries as you would normally do.
Please submit a zip archive containing all your source code artifacts in a way that it can run at least on a
standard terminal as a small text-based client (no UI necessary).
Please note that, along with the functionality of your code, we will also evaluate its quality and style.
Details
Assume you have a hotel with 3 rooms:
Day 0 Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5
Room 1
Room 2
Room 3
Let's represent bookings as tuple: (startDay, endDay), e.g. (0, 2). Guests always book full days: the
booking (0, 0) blocks one room only on day 0. The booking (1, 3) will block a room for days 1/2/3.
After bookings (0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 4) and (2, 2) (which we all accept) our hotel might for example look
like this.
Day 0 Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5
Room 1 X X X X
Room 2 X X X
Room 3 X
We would now have to decline another booking (2, 3).
Notes:
Days are represented as the number of days from a certain date, e.g. day 0, day 1, day 2, ...; We will limit
bookings to 1 year, that is 365 days.
All rooms are identical and may be assumed to be numbered. The size of your hotel is size <= 1000.
Guest do not change the room during their stay, but always stay within the room they moved in initially.
If a booking request arrives and we can accept it, we accept it directly. We do not wait for later requests
(e.g. to maximize the utilization of our rooms).
If there are multiple rooms available for booking, the one with the smallest room number is chosen first.
In case of additional questions: Feel free to make necessary assumptions. If you do so, please state and shortly
explain your assumptions in your code.
Test Cases
Please inspect the following test cases and implement them accordingly. You may also consider additional test
cases, if you think they are meaningful.
1a/1b: Requests outside our planning period are declined (Size=1)
StartDate EndDate Result: Accept / Decline
Booking 1 -4 2 Decline
and
StartDate EndDate Result: Accept / Decline
Booking 1 200 400 Decline
2: Requests are accepted (Size=3)
StartDate EndDate Result: Accept / Decline
Booking 1 0 5 Accept
Booking 2 7 13 Accept
Booking 3 3 9 Accept
Booking 4 5 7 Accept
Booking 5 6 6 Accept
Booking 6 0 4 Accept
3: Requests are declined (Size=3)
StartDate EndDate Result: Accept / Decline
Booking 1 1 3 Accept
Booking 2 2 5 Accept
Booking 3 1 9 Accept
StartDate EndDate Result: Accept / Decline
Booking 4 0 15 Decline
4: Requests can be accepted after a decline (Size=3)
StartDate EndDate Result: Accept / Decline
Booking 1 1 3 Accept
Booking 2 0 15 Accept
Booking 3 1 9 Accept
Booking 4 2 5 Decline
Booking 5 4 9 Accept
5: Complex Requests (Size=2)
StartDate EndDate Result: Accept / Decline
Booking 1 1 3 Accept
Booking 2 0 4 Accept
Booking 3 2 3 Decline
Booking 4 5 5 Accept
Booking 5 4 10 Decline
Booking 6 10 10 Accept
Booking 7 6 7 Accept
Booking 8 8 10 Accept
Booking 9 8 9 Accept
