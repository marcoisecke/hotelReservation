Hotel Reservations

Background

#Imagine you own a hotel with a certain number of identical rooms - let's call this number the size of your hotel.
Your clients would like to make reservations for rooms: They e.g. call to check if they can make a reservation for
one room from a certain start date start until a certain end date end. For each booking request you will have
to check if there is a room available and either confirm the booking or reject it.
